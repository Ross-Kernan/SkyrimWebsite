            <p id="Breezehome_text">Located in Whiterun, Breezehome sits adjacent to Warmaiden's and Whiterun's Gate. It is usually the first house that can be bought, and costs 5000 Gold. Physically, it resembles many of the other houses of Whiterun, with pale wooden walls, a few windows and a shingled roof.<br><br>It can be purchased from Proventus Avenicci after the Jarl of Whiterun, Balgruuf the Greater, allows the purchasing of property, or from Brill if the Dragonborn has completed the "Battle for Whiterun" for the Stormcloaks. It can be bought immediately after retrieving the Dragonstone for the quest "Bleak Falls Barrow." Proventus Avenicci or Brill do not sell upgrades when they are on the porch of Dragonsreach, only in the dining room. Siding with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War requires the Dragonborn to perform certain tasks, as well as purchase Breezehome, in order to reinstate themselves as Thane of Whiterun.<br><br>Siding with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War requires the Dragonborn to perform certain tasks, as well as purchase Breezehome, in order to reinstate themselves as Thane of Whiterun.<br><br>Breezehome is an inexpensive home and can be easily acquired early in the game, but it is the only home that lacks an enchanting table and mannequin. In order to enchant in Whiterun, the Dragonborn must exit Breezehome (one transition), head to Dragonsreach, then enter (another transition) and walk up the steps to the enchanting table.<br><br>For members of the Thieves Guild, the fence in Whiterun, Mallus Maccius, is located outside of the city entirely, at Honningbrew Meadery following the Thieves Guild quest "Dampened Spirits," requiring fast-travel and extra transitions any time the Dragonborn wishes to move stolen goods. However, this is not an issue with the Fence perk at 90 speech.<br><br>Breezehome is, however, convenient for blacksmiths due to its proximity to Warmaiden's, the Skyforge, and wood chopping blocks DG for creating arrows.<br><br>In the Hearthfire add-on, a courier will deliver a message called Breezehome Furnishings, which allows the Dragonborn to buy an extra room for the Adoption of children. This upgrade will replace the alchemy lab, although the option to change upgrades will always remain available. Any items stored in the barrel next to the staircase will then be moved to the nearby cupboard.</p>

            <h3 id="Hjerim_title">Hjerim</h3>
            <p id="Hjerim_text">It is located in the Valunstrad quarter of Windhelm. The house has two floors, several spacious rooms and a hidden chamber. Hjerim also has a large armory with a number of mannequins, display cases, shelves, and weapon racks. It originally belonged to Friga Shatter-Shield, until she was tragically murdered by the Butcher.<br><br>The secret chamber, hidden behind a ground-floor wardrobe to the rear of the first floor, is where the Butcher kept the severed body parts of his victims with which he intended to reanimate his dead sister. Purchasing the cleanup package will clear its bloodstained furnishings, enabling the purchase of the needed upgrades to transform it into a combined Alchemy and Enchanting workshop.<br><br>The house is available for 12,000 Gold. Purchasing all upgrades costs an additional 9,000 Gold. Completing "Rescue from Fort Neugrad" (for the Stormcloaks), or the full Civil War questline for the Imperials is necessary to purchase this house. Upon becoming a Thane of Eastmarch, a housecarl, Calder, will be assigned by the Jarl to look after Hjerim and serve the new Thane.<br><br>A part of the quest "Blood on the Ice" takes place here, but the purchase of the property is available before or during the quest, giving the Dragonborn the key to the house which allows entry to the house without having to pick the master lock on the front door. The key can also be obtained during or after "Blood on the Ice" by pickpocketing it from or talking to Tova Shatter-Shield. The quest is automatically gained when entering the house for the first time, if not previously started. Talking to the Jarl's Steward, Jorleif, enables the purchase of decorations for Hjerim; however, the quest "Blood on the Ice" must be completed before buying decorations and the cleanup package from Jorleif, or else glitches ensue.</p>

Any citizen who desires to become Thane of the Rift must purchase property within its realm, and Honeyside is the only property available for purchase by the Dragonborn.<br><br>With its exterior entry, tanning rack, cooking place, alchemy lab, and arcane enchanter, Honeyside can be a useful home for hunters and those who are interested in alchemy or enchanting. Also, Honeyside is one of two purchasable houses in a city in Skyrim that have exterior areas (porch, dock, and garden), while the other is Solitude's Proudspire Manor.<br><br>Honeyside can only be acquired on the path to becoming a Thane of Riften. To achieve this, the Dragonborn must have good reputation with Riften citizens and have proven their worth to the Jarl. Below are the steps to acquiring Honeyside.<br><br>After enough reputation has been acquired, the Dragonborn can talk to the Jarl's Steward, Anuriel, or Hemming Black-Briar, if the Civil War quest line was completed for the Imperials, who will offer to sell a house for 8,000 Gold, but may be bought for as little as 5,000 Gold. If one has at least 5,000 Gold, the option of "I'll take it" will be available. With this option selected, she will take all of the Dragonborn's gold, up to 8,000 Gold, and give them the key to Honeyside and the Riften Home Decorating Guide.<br><br>She will then sell upgrades to the property.<br><br>Honeyside can also be purchased after the completion of the Skyrim Civil War questline if Maven Black-Briar is made Jarl.<br><br>Honeyside is located in the northwest corner of Riften. It can be reached from outside the city by following the path directly west of the Riften Stables.</p>

It is located next to the Bards College and Vittoria Vici's House on the east side of Solitude. Though initially blighted by dust and cobwebs, renovating it will improve its appearance.<br><br>When walking towards the Blue Palace, there is a fire in a brazier on the left just before the Bards College. Proudspire Manor is the door before the brazier. It can also be accessed by going up the steps before that doorway; Vittoria Vici's house is the door to the left, while Proudspire Manor is the door on the right. The exterior of the manor has a fair amount of flowers that respawn in a few game weeks if picked.<br><br>This manor may be bought for 25,000 Gold from Falk Firebeard after completing "The Man Who Cried Wolf" and "Elisif's Tribute." The total cost (including decorations) is 39,000 Gold, or 36,000 Gold, if one lacks the Hearthfire add-on. Buying this house is one of the things that must be done before becoming a Thane of Haafingar. With the Hearthfire add-on, a children's room may be added for 3,000 Gold. The doorway to it replaces the two shelves to the left of the master bedroom's entrance.</p>

            <p id="Severin_Manor_text">Severin Manor is a large, Redoran-style manor located in the north-west corner of Raven Rock, midway between the market square and the Earth Stone. It is the only ownable property available to the player on Solstheim.<br><br>Initially, it is the home of Vendil Severin, and his family. However, upon completion of the quest "Served Cold," Severin Manor is awarded as a home to the Dragonborn by Lleril Morvayn.<br><br>Severin Manor is a fairly large home, with the main advantage of being fully upgraded upon being obtained. There is an antechamber upon entering with a cooking pot at the fireplace, and a large, subterranean second level downstairs. Downstairs on the first left there is a small bedroom containing a small garden with ash yams and scathecraw, a chest and numerous barrels containing both Alchemy ingredients and vegetables. Across (the first right) is a full smithing workshop, containing a smelter, a workbench, a grindstone and a tanning rack along with two weapon racks and training dummies. To the right of the smelter there is a large trough containing several iron and steel ingots.<br><br>On the second left there is an alchemy lab, which, along with other assorted ingredients, has six separate lots of fire salts (useful for the quest Stoking the Flames) along with unique ingredients only found on Solstheim. However, there is a lack of ingredients encountered in Skyrim or acquired from Skyrim's wildlife, with only a few assorted mountain flowers and other common alchemy ingredients. An arcane enchanter is across (the second right), with six normal weapon plaques and three shield racks surrounding it, more than any other obtainable house. There are also many soul gems, though there are none better than common soul gems.<br><br>There is one large master bedroom, which has four mannequins, four chests, three display cases, bookshelves and a safe. The mannequins have weapon racks on either side, totaling eight. Storage for the lower level is excellent, with many barrels, chests and urns, as well as weapons racks and mannequins. The lighting, however, is poor in many areas in the basement.</p>

Morthal, the Hold capital, lies a fair distance to the southwest. If "Lights Out!" has been started, the shipwreck of the Icerunner will appear just a few yards away to the northeast.<br><br>Upon completion of the quest "Laid to Rest," this site can be bought from the steward of Hjaalmarch at Highmoon Hall in Morthal for 5,000 Gold. Depending on the progress of the Civil War, this steward will be either Aslfur or Pactur. The dialogue option will say, "I'd like to purchase a house." However, when that option is chosen, the steward will say that there are no houses available, but there is some land.</p>

If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion during the Civil War questline, then Brina Merilis will offer it out of gratitude. Both will sell the property for 5,000 Gold.</p>
