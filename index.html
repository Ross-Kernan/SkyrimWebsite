        <p class="intro_text">Just some basic info that will help you understand just exactly what Skyrim is so you're not entirely confused looking through the website, feel free to skip if you already know about the series or don't care. Skyrims official name is 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim' as its the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, its predecessors being nowhere near as successful as the series Golden Goose. The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion comprised most of skyrims production team so its very close to the same game at heart. Skyrim was originally released on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC in 2011, but with its remastered edition known as Skyrim: Special Edition is has now been released on Xbox One, PS4, PC again, Xbox Series X, PS5 and Nintendo Switch, it also recieved a VR specialised edition which was released on the PS4VR and PC in 2017. Skyrim is classified as an RPG, Open World, Action Adventure game for ages 18 and up and according to 'HowLongToBeatâ„¢', it would take the average person roughly 282 hours or 12 days to finish Skyrim in its entirety. It takes place in another world unlike ours and is referred to as Tamriel which houses all of the other locations used in the game series such as The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind taking place in Morrowind, and The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion being in Cyrodiil.</p>
